# SQL Query Data Analytics Practice

**This repository stores a number of SQL queries I did while in an advanced SQL class during my studies at the university of Colorado Boulder.
The file that exists within is formatted as text and contains many examples of exposure I've had to the language coalesced together. The reason this
file is in this format is because much of it was done in Google BigQuery, the google cloud-based IDE for SQL, and these cloud files cannot be exported
in the same way the Python, C++, and R files can. Instead, I took the work I did from various homeworks, projects, and exams and formatted them as one
large text file. While this can be confusing to disect, you will find notes throughout that indicate problems I was trying to solve or techniques
that I was looking to get comfortable with. Despite the poor formatting, I am comfortable explaining in lamens terms every aspect of this code
and what it is trying to accomplish.**

The file within this repository contains examples of SQL work I have done in the past formatted as a text file. Within it are instances of basic
select, from, where, and having clauses to disect bigquery public data as well as example data provided by the course instructor mirroring common
company records. The example company data includes tables for customers, employees, invoices, products, and vendors. Beyond simple analysis with
select, from, where, and having, I utilized Joins, Unions, Rollup functions, coalesce, subqueries, and inline views to make pertinent discoveries
while exploring the information. My exposure extended to DDL examples where I learned to Create, Replace, and Alter Tables as well as Insert, Update, and 
Delete. Furthermore, my experience extends to the creation of CTEs to create temporary result sets only for use within the context of the larger query
and permanent views that would serve well in a real world context to dispatch data to various segments of a larger team so that they would only have
access to those features relevant to their project, maintaing data privacy and governance. While my experience went in depth with certain analysis
and limited DDL, I did not get an opportunity to connect live sources and data lakes, with the exception of BigQuery public data, that would update 
automatically. Despite this, I take pride in my ability to quickly obtain necessary skills to complete a project, and should the need arise to develop
these skills, I can't imagine it would be very difficult to figure out. Backgrounds with APIs, HTTP requests, and live data structures in other 
languages would serve well to help me in this pursuit in the future. Have a look at my work and let me know what you think!
